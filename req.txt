On mobile,
1. Text is too small throughout the site   *DONE*
2. Footer text too small and doesnt layout nicely
3. No logo or name at top of page visible on load - So when page loads, theres no mention of Infinity Finance or logo (could be any companys website)
4. Apply Now buttons are too small through site
5. Add an Apply now button to middle under slider and before the text "Bike Caravan or car finance" header
6. Most customers contact us through whatsapp so it needs to be noticeable on page load, maybe add it to the menu at the top as well? Make whatsapp icon bigger/noticeable, make it green and add the link to our whatsapp: https://wa.me/message/ES2P7U5QKHLBN1
7. Menu (top left) too small to choose options easily
8 . Contact us page - Should be a gap / space between bottom of map and form so it looks ok.
