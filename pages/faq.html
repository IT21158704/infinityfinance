            <li><b>FAQ’s Introduction</b>
                <ul class="mt-2" type="a">
                    <li>We have found that some questions are easily answered so please check below. If you have any other questions please feel free to call us on 0161 292 8200 or email info@infinityfinance.co.uk.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3"><b>Infinity finance</b>
                <ul class="mt-2" type="a">
                    <li>Infinity Finance is a licensed credit broker and not a lender, we will introduce customers to a limited number of finance providers and may receive a commission for such introductions.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3"><b>I need my finance fast, how long do you take?</b>
                <ul class="mt-2" type="a">
                    <li>We can pay the dealer out same day for the vehicle, so you could actually drive away the car the same day if it’s ready to go!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3"><b>So, once I apply what happens?</b>
                <ul class="mt-2" type="a">
                    <li>We review your application and pass it to one of our lenders who best fits your personal and credit circumstances.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3"><b>I’m not sure I want to make an online application, what about security?</b>
                <ul class="mt-2" type="a">
                    <li>The application is secure and you can tell this by looking for the padlock sign on the application page in your browser. All data is encrypted from this point, so you can be assured that nobody is able to collect your data apart from us, where the data is encrypted. If your still unsure, call us in working hours and we will take the details down over the telephone. When making online applications, you should always ensure that the page you are entering your data on displays the padlock image and shows it is secure.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3"><b>When do I get an answer after making an application?</b>
                <ul class="mt-2" type="a">
                    <li>Usually immediately, there may be some instances where it will drag over to the following day. For instance applying in the evening, outside of our business hours, weekends or only providing some not all the information required on the form.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3"><b>I don’t know if I can get finance, any tips?</b>
                <ul class="mt-2" type="a">
                    <li>The best thing you can do is tell the truth, don’t think for a moment that if you don’t put the correct address history in we won’t be able to tell. Missing an address off because you have adverse credit there will get you declined. Missing important fields because you can’t be bothered to fill in the form will not help your application. Another “for instance” are those applicants who don’t put their home telephone number in because they don’t want people calling them. Having a home telephone (land line) number is a positive point when underwriting a loan application. The bottom line is that if you tell the truth and provide all the information asked for on the form, you have the best chance of being approved. Being devious, misleading, untruthful and downright dishonest will get you declined.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3"><b>I have good credit what’s the APR?</b>
                <ul class="mt-2" type="a">
                    <li>The fact of the matter in the current credit market is that you may indeed have excellent credit; however, lenders are being very restrictive. Whereas last year you had letters by the dozen offering you credit through the letterbox, this has now dried up. Lenders are looking for certain profiles of customer; this means the deals you were offered 12 months ago are not there anymore for many customers. We will inform you of a payment and APR when we notify you of the approval. If the deal is good for you then great we can proceed, if it’s not then you can find another financier.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3"><b>I’m interested in a PCP, Lease. lease hire etc.</b>
                <ul class="mt-2" type="a">
                    <li>We only finance with Hire Purchase and Conditional Sale schemes. This means you own the vehicle after you have finished paying for it.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3"><b>I’m approved, what’s the deal on proofs I have to supply?</b>
                <ul class="mt-2" type="a">
                    <li>Standard requirements for employed applicants are only. Your Driving Licence Number and your Bank Details for the Direct Debit. We only ask for these when you have found the vehicle and want to proceed. Our finance plans are very easy and simple. On rare occasions we might ask for proof of income.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3"><b>Where do I get the vehicle from, where do I start looking?</b>
                <ul class="mt-2" type="a">
                    <li>We <b>DO NOT</b> supply the vehicle, we only supply the finance. You can visit and view any dealer in your local area; you can negotiate the deal knowing the finance is in place for you. If the dealer asks, you just tell them that your finance is in place and you will get us to call the dealer when you’re happy with the deal you have got. You can find the vehicle on an internet dealer site if you wish.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3"><b>What about a deposit, do I need to put one down?</b>
                <ul class="mt-2" type="a">
                    <li>We do not usually require you to put a deposit down. Unless stated otherwise, we assume that the customer would rather not put a deposit down and we’re happy with that. If you are unsure, please call us.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3"><b>How sure am I that the vehicle is ok?</b>
                <ul class="mt-2" type="a">
                    <li>We will undertake a vehicle check for you when you have located the vehicle. We will of course advise you of any problems such as – incorrect mileage, accident damage, insurance claims or write off, outstanding finance owing. This gives you the peace of mind that the vehicle that you’re buying is clear of all these “hidden” things.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3"><b>What about imports, will you finance them?</b>
                <ul class="mt-2" type="a">
                    <li>No, we do not finance any imported vehicles.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3"><b>I have found the vehicle I want to buy, what now?</b>
                <ul class="mt-2" type="a">
                    <li>If it’s a car or bike, call us with the Registration Number and the Mileage, If it’s a caravan then the CRIS number is needed. Tell us what the agreed price is. We will then undertake the vehicle check and advise you that we’re good to proceed. We will then organise a full quote for you and E-sign.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3"><b>I’ve been quoted and agreed to proceed, what happens next?</b>
                <ul class="mt-2" type="a">
                    <li>We make contact with the dealer and set everything up for you. We email you your E-sign documents. When you have E-signed, then we start the payout process and pay the dealer for your vehicle so you could be driving away as soon as possible.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3"><b>I need the vehicle urgently, how quick can I have it?</b>
                <ul class="mt-2" type="a">
                    <li>If you require a same day pay out we need the E-sign completed by you and the dealer paperwork in our office by 12 noon. You should speak to us beforehand so we are aware of your requirements, only telling us when you sign the paperwork doesn’t work for anybody. Apart from this you need to make sure that the dealer is in a position to let the vehicle go, for instance the vehicle might need a service or MOT which will delay things.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3"><b>I have picked the vehicle up now, is there anything else I need to know?</b>
                <ul class="mt-2" type="a">
                    <li>You must keep the vehicle fully comprehensively insured throughout the loan period.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3"><b>Finally from us…</b>
                <ul class="mt-2" type="a">
                    <li>We believe that you will find Infinity professional, understanding and approachable. We will never try and hide behind “business talk” or use phrases that you do not understand. We hope that by dealing with customers as we would like to be treated ourselves, we hope to maintain our good reputation.</li>
