We have tried to make the information contained within this site as clear, easy to use and as accurate as possible.

                    <li>If you are applying for finance or other services in joint names, this will create a financial link between both applicants in our and that of our appointed lenders records and the records held at the credit reference agencies. This means that your financial affairs and those of your joint applicant may be treated as affecting each other.</li>
